# llmChatAppBackend

This repository contains the backend code for the LLM Chat App project.

## Repository Structure

- `.idea/`  
  Contains IDE-specific configuration files. This folder is automatically generated by JetBrains IDEs (such as IntelliJ IDEA or PyCharm) and is not part of the application's core logic.

- `llmChatApp/`  
  This is the main application directory. It contains the source code for the backend services powering the LLM Chat App.

## Core Functionality
